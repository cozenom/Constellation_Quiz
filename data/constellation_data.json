The Arabs also gave the name in short form as al-ʿanaq, which became transliterated into Medieval Latin as alamac. Later, the derivatin of alamac was erroneously attributed to the assumed Arabic word al-maq (properly al-muq) for \"the boot\" or \"buskin\", rather than to al-ʿanaq. Subsequently the erroneous word, as \"Almaak\" and later \"Almach\" was applied as a star name to γ And, mostly in astronomical works in English.

It seems that later Arabic poets expanded upon this name by making mention of some separate \"lance\" (al-rumh) that accompanied the star α Boo. Subsequent Arabs attempted to identify this fictitious lance with actual stars, sometimes saying it was η Boo with nearby stars, sometimes saying it was \"η Boo alone\" (where \"alone\", in arabic, is written mufradan). From these discussions came, with a slight copying mistake in the Arabic, the erroneous Arabic name mufrad al-ramih, roughly translating as \"the Isolated Single One of the Lance-Bearer\". With a wrong vocalization and with abbreviation, this erroneous name, as \"Muphrid\", was applied in recent times."

From this usage, al-muhlifan was wrongly taken as a name for hadari and al-wazn together. Transliterated and further mutilated as \"Muliphein\", the name was arbitrarily applied to the single star γ CMa in recent times."

Perhaps as an attempt to explain the significance of al-ghumaisa', as well as that of the surname al-<abur, \"the One Having Crossed Over [a river, etc.],\" for α CMa, an Arabic fable developed associating these and other equally enigmatic star names. According to one version of the  fable, al-ghumaisa and ai-'abur were sisters, and their brother was suhail (α Car). Suhail, in turn, was the suitor of al-jauza' (the feminine pre-Islamic Arabian figure in place of Orion). In coitus, suhail broke the spine of al-jauza', thus killing her, after which suhail fled south. He was followed by his sister al-'abur who \"crossed over\" the Milky Way (where the two stars now lie in the southern sky). Meanwhile suhail's second sister, al-ghumaisa, was left alone north of the Milky Way, weeping, until her \"eyes became bleary.\" (The pre-Islamic Arabian name for α CMa was al-shi'ra, of unknown meaning. Apparently it was developed into a dualis form, al-shi'rayan, to accomodate both α CMa and α CMi, with the aforementioned \"surnames\" distinguishing the two.)"

Some European astronomers copied and translated it, though. The constellation became obsolete in the depolitisation of the IAU-sky and WGSN only resembles the Keeper, Custos."

It comprises four of the five stars forming the constellation Wangliang (王良) and represents the four horses pulling the chariot. It may thus be regarded as a constituent sub-constellation/asterism of Wangliang (王良). In the literature in English, the name \"Ce\" (old spelling: Tsih) can be found; WGSN corrects this misapplication of an old star name."

The erroneous derivation understood since Early Modern times was from al-dhira (al-)yamin, \"the Right Forearm,\" an assumed Arabic descriptive term for α Cep. Firstly, in the Almagest, α Cep is described on the right \"shoulder\" (Arabic al-katif or al-mankib) of Cepheus, whereas no right \"forearm\" (al-dhira<) is described for the figure. Secondly, in Arabic, \"right forearm\" is spelled correctly as al-dhira al-yumna, which (in contrast to al-yamin) lacks assonance in the last syllable to Alderamin. Therefore, it is more likely that Alderamin is derived from the various medieval Christian abbreviations of muqaddam al-dhira<ain, \"the Preceding One of the Two Cubits, or Forearms,\" which was a name for the Arabic Almagest period (based on pre-Islamic Arabian) for α Gem. This would have been wrongly transferred to α Cep in medieval times."

The Medieval Latin translator of the Arabic Almagest, in turn, did not recognize any Greek word behind urnis (or whatever Arabic corruption he may have read), so he merely transliterated it into a form which appeared int he manuscripts variously as eurisim, eirisun, eirism, etc. In a note appended to this Medieval Latin constellation name for Cygnus, one Latin commentator ventured to derive it from the name of an aromatic herb he knew: ireus. This erroneous commentary read, in brief part: \"eirisim...ab ireo\", or, \"[the constellation name] eirisim...[coming] from [the word] ireus\". Apparently in one manuscript of the Latin Almagest, the final word of this commentary, ab ireo, were written on the next line below the constellation title, where the descriptions of the stars begin. Since the first star entered in the Almagest under the constellation Cygnus is β Cyg, the words ab ireo seem to have been confused as a name for this star. \"Arabicized\" with the insertion of the letter \"l\", ab ireo, written as \"Albireo\", was applied as a star name to β Cyg by Early Modern times."

The reference was intended to apply to the pre-Islamic Arabian figure located in today's Orion, however it was under the constellation which is today Gemini that the reference appeared (note the confusion between Orion and Gemini mentioned under α Ori).

These pairs were assigned to the larger pre-Islamic Arabian asterism al-asad, but there is no unanimity in the Arabic sources as to which pair was the \"outstretched\" or \"folded\" paw. \"Mebsuta\" was arbitrarily applied as a star name to ε Gem in recent times. In its indigenous location stretching from parts of Gemini all the way into Virgo, the pre-Islamic Arabian al-asad, \"the Lion,\" corresponded to what in other cultures was Leo among the zodiacal signs. Subsequently the Arabs used the indigenous name for the smaller Greek Lion (Leo)."

Stimson's Tuamotuan dictionary (1964: 526) gives the meaning of Tīaki as \"guardian\", \"keeper\" or \"watchman\", but does not list it as a star. He does, however, list Tīakitau as the name of an unidentified star on Anaa, which Makemson (1941: 261 #660) lists separately."

Thus by Early Modern times both the \"y\" and \"d\" of the first part of the pre-Islamic Arabian name had become corrupted.) The pre-Islamic Arabian asterism al-jauza' was a feminine figure represented in the stars of what is today Orion. The origin of its name is unclear (as with nearly all of the ancient group of pre-Islamic Arabian names). The root jwz can mean \"middle,\" and the word al-jauza' is structured as a feminine adjective, thus al-jauza' may mean \"the female one, having something about her related to the middle.\" There have been different speculations as to what the \"middle\" reference, if that is what it is, could be (for one example). The pre-Islamic Arabians' al-jauza' corresponded to what in other cultures was Gemini among the zodiacal signs. The Arabics subsequently used the indigenous name for both the Greek Orion and Twins, leading to some confusion in star names between the two constellations. An alternative name for the Arabic Almagest period for Orion was al-jabbar, \"the Giant\" and for Gemini, al-taw'aman, \"the Twins.\""

The nearby stars λ, ϕ1, and ϕ2 Ori composed the adjacent 5th lunar mansion al-haq'a. Due to confusion between these two parent lunar mansions in a late Arabic source, \"Meissa\" was wrongly applied to λ Ori (rather than to γ or ξ Gem) in recent times. \"Meissa\" (without n at the end) corresponds to pre-Islamic Arabian almaisa', a variant form of al-maisan."

Wurren gives water to Gawalyan, the echidna (Achernar), which they direct Earthly initiates to carry in small bowls. The water came from a great waterfall used to cool the people during the ceremony. Just as the water at the base of the waterfall keeps people cool and rises to the sky as mist, the water in the initiates’ bowls keeps them cool and symbolically transforms into clouds that bring the wet rains of the monsoon season. These ceremonies occur in late December when the weather is hot and these stars are high in the evening sky, signalling the start of the monsoon."

It is also possible that this \"cord\" was a remnant of the cord joining the two fish of the older Babylonian zodiac. Indeed, these stars of the cord were alternatively known by the pre-Islamic Arabians as al-hut, \"the Fish\" (a single fish), corresponding to what in other cultures was Pisces among the zodiacal signs (and according to this tradition, the Fish's brightest star, β And, was batn al-hut, \"the Fish's Belly\")."

In Early Modern times, the derivation of alascha was erroneously attributed to the Arabic word las'a, \"sting, or bite (of a poisonous animal),\" rather than to al-latkha.

It is located at the southern coast of Mesopotamia. The identification of the star or asterism is highly uncertain: it is often identified with Canopus and adjacent areas or \"somewhere in Argo\". ᵐᵘˡNUN.KI is listed in MUL.APIN and there, it seems to refer to the area of Aquarius with unknown identification (Canopus not excluded) but the identification with other Babylonian texts seems to propose only in the northern part of modern Argo, i.e. Vela. The Euphratean name \"Nunki\" was mentioned and associated with Sigma Sgr in Robert Brown, Jr. (1892, Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Volume 14, p. 298; \"Nun-ki\", \"Prince-of-the-Earth\"), and its use diffused through the 20th century after being mentioned in Richard Hinckley Allen's (Star Names, their lore and meaning, p. 359). The modern Nunki is, thus, not identical with the Sumerian one; it is one of the many misapplications."

There are at least 21 spelling variants throughout the millennia in hierglyphs, and it is probably not any specific bird; might be a goose or falcon or something else. Four star names within the constellation are attested in Ramesside Star Clocks and identified with the area between α, β Per and all of Triangulum. WGSN adopts the name of the constellation for any unspecific spot within its area to preserve an old Egyptian cultural name."

The star is a spectroscopic binary which is why it makes sense to give it a double-name for the visible dot; the name may be split for the components later."

In subsequent Latin copies, this name was further corrupted to aliore, Alcor, Alioth, etc. Since late medieval times, \"Alioth\" became the preferred name for ε UMa."

Correct transliterations of almaraqq in the Medieval Latin Almagest were mirac and mirach. However, Early Modern scholars confused these words with the Arabic word mi'zar, which had equally been transliterated and corrupted in Latin as mirac, mirach, etc. Subsequently the mistaken mi'zar, written as \"Mizar,\" was applied as a star name to β UMa, and it became transferred to ζ UMa in late Early Modern times."

The constellation first appeared in Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia (1687) and the accompanying introductory text, Prodromus astronomiae (1690). To emphasize that it was his own creation, Hevelius dedicated Figure L to the pair, shown as a detail in Fig. 3.1. In atlases published before Hevelius, its stars are shown simply marking the flow of the Milky Way through the area. Ian Ridpath (1989) noted that “Hevelius placed the fox near two other hunting animals, the eagle (the constellation Aquila) and the vulture (which was an alternative identification for Lyra). He explained that the fox was taking the goose to neighbouring Cerberus, another of his inventions.”unnamed before."

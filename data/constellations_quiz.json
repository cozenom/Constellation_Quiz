Later, the derivatin of alamac was erroneously attributed to the assumed Arabic word al-maq (properly al-muq) for \"the boot\" or \"buskin\", rather than to al-ʿanaq. Subsequently the erroneous word, as \"Almaak\" and later \"Almach\" was applied as a star name to γ And, mostly in astronomical works in English.

Subsequent Arabs attempted to identify this fictitious lance with actual stars, sometimes saying it was η Boo with nearby stars, sometimes saying it was \"η Boo alone\" (where \"alone\", in arabic, is written mufradan). From these discussions came, with a slight copying mistake in the Arabic, the erroneous Arabic name mufrad al-ramih, roughly translating as \"the Isolated Single One of the Lance-Bearer\".

Perhaps as an attempt to explain the significance of al-ghumaisa', as well as that of the surname al-<abur, \"the One Having Crossed Over [a river, etc.],\" for α CMa, an Arabic fable developed associating these and other equally enigmatic star names. According to one version of the  fable, al-ghumaisa and ai-'abur were sisters, and their brother was suhail (α Car). Suhail, in turn, was the suitor of al-jauza' (the feminine pre-Islamic Arabian figure in place of Orion). In coitus, suhail broke the spine of al-jauza', thus killing her, after which suhail fled south. He was followed by his sister al-'abur who \"crossed over\" the Milky Way (where the two stars now lie in the southern sky). Meanwhile suhail's second sister, al-ghumaisa, was left alone north of the Milky Way, weeping, until her \"eyes became bleary.\" (The pre-Islamic Arabian name for α CMa was al-shi'ra, of unknown meaning. Apparently it was developed into a dualis form, al-shi'rayan, to accomodate both α CMa and α CMi, with the aforementioned \"surnames\" distinguishing the two.)"

Secondly, in Arabic, \"right forearm\" is spelled correctly as al-dhira al-yumna, which (in contrast to al-yamin) lacks assonance in the last syllable to Alderamin. Therefore, it is more likely that Alderamin is derived from the various medieval Christian abbreviations of muqaddam al-dhira<ain, \"the Preceding One of the Two Cubits, or Forearms,\" which was a name for the Arabic Almagest period (based on pre-Islamic Arabian) for α Gem.

This erroneous commentary read, in brief part: \"eirisim...ab ireo\", or, \"[the constellation name] eirisim...[coming] from [the word] ireus\". Apparently in one manuscript of the Latin Almagest, the final word of this commentary, ab ireo, were written on the next line below the constellation title, where the descriptions of the stars begin. Since the first star entered in the Almagest under the constellation Cygnus is β Cyg, the words ab ireo seem to have been confused as a name for this star. \"Arabicized\" with the insertion of the letter \"l\", ab ireo, written as \"Albireo\", was applied as a star name to β Cyg by Early Modern times."

The reference was intended to apply to the pre-Islamic Arabian figure located in today's Orion, however it was under the constellation which is today Gemini that the reference appeared (note the confusion between Orion and Gemini mentioned under α Ori). Therefore, after  transliteration into Latin, it was in Gemini (to δ) that the word \"Wasat\" was arbitrarily applied as a star name in recent times."

Thus by Early Modern times both the \"y\" and \"d\" of the first part of the pre-Islamic Arabian name had become corrupted.) The pre-Islamic Arabian asterism al-jauza' was a feminine figure represented in the stars of what is today Orion. The origin of its name is unclear (as with nearly all of the ancient group of pre-Islamic Arabian names). The root jwz can mean \"middle,\" and the word al-jauza' is structured as a feminine adjective, thus al-jauza' may mean \"the female one, having something about her related to the middle.\" There have been different speculations as to what the \"middle\" reference, if that is what it is, could be (for one example). The pre-Islamic Arabians' al-jauza' corresponded to what in other cultures was Gemini among the zodiacal signs. The Arabics subsequently used the indigenous name for both the Greek Orion and Twins, leading to some confusion in star names between the two constellations. An alternative name for the Arabic Almagest period for Orion was al-jabbar, \"the Giant\" and for Gemini, al-taw'aman, \"the Twins.\""

Wurren means “child” and refers to the “Little Fish”, a child of Dungdung – the life-creating Frog Lady. Wurren gives water to Gawalyan, the echidna (Achernar), which they direct Earthly initiates to carry in small bowls. The water came from a great waterfall used to cool the people during the ceremony. Just as the water at the base of the waterfall keeps people cool and rises to the sky as mist, the water in the initiates’ bowls keeps them cool and symbolically transforms into clouds that bring the wet rains of the monsoon season. These ceremonies occur in late December when the weather is hot and these stars are high in the evening sky, signalling the start of the monsoon."

It is also possible that this \"cord\" was a remnant of the cord joining the two fish of the older Babylonian zodiac. Indeed, these stars of the cord were alternatively known by the pre-Islamic Arabians as al-hut, \"the Fish\" (a single fish), corresponding to what in other cultures was Pisces among the zodiacal signs (and according to this tradition, the Fish's brightest star, β And, was batn al-hut, \"the Fish's Belly\")."

It is located at the southern coast of Mesopotamia. The identification of the star or asterism is highly uncertain: it is often identified with Canopus and adjacent areas or \"somewhere in Argo\". ᵐᵘˡNUN.KI is listed in MUL.APIN and there, it seems to refer to the area of Aquarius with unknown identification (Canopus not excluded) but the identification with other Babylonian texts seems to propose only in the northern part of modern Argo, i.e. Vela. The Euphratean name \"Nunki\" was mentioned and associated with Sigma Sgr in Robert Brown, Jr. (1892, Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Volume 14, p. 298; \"Nun-ki\", \"Prince-of-the-Earth\"), and its use diffused through the 20th century after being mentioned in Richard Hinckley Allen's (Star Names, their lore and meaning, p. 359). The modern Nunki is, thus, not identical with the Sumerian one; it is one of the many misapplications."

To emphasize that it was his own creation, Hevelius dedicated Figure L to the pair, shown as a detail in Fig. 3.1. In atlases published before Hevelius, its stars are shown simply marking the flow of the Milky Way through the area. Ian Ridpath (1989) noted that “Hevelius placed the fox near two other hunting animals, the eagle (the constellation Aquila) and the vulture (which was an alternative identification for Lyra). He explained that the fox was taking the goose to neighbouring Cerberus, another of his inventions.”unnamed before."
